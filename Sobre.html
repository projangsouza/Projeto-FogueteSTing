        <h2> Application</h2>
        <br>
       <p>
        Rockets play a crucial role in several areas: Space exploration, where they are used to launch spacecraft and probes that expand our knowledge of the universe. Global communication, by placing communication satellites in orbit, allowing the transmission of information on a global scale, providing telephony, internet, radio and navigation services. Earth observation and monitoring, launching satellites that collect data on climate and environment.

        <h2>HANBIT-TLV</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The HANBIT-TLV, developed by INNOSPACE, is a test rocket weighing 8.4 tons and 16.3 meters high. It uses a hybrid propulsion system, with liquid oxygen and a mixture of paraffins, which provides a stable chemical composition, faster manufacturing and lower cost. Its aerodynamic shape is designed to reduce air resistance, optimizing in-flight performance and ensuring stability. Rocket design takes into account several factors, such as payload, chosen propulsion and specific requirements of the company or space agency responsible for the project, aiming at aerodynamic efficiency, stability and other technical constraints.

        <h2>
          SMART Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          In general, the rocket is designed with several considerations in mind, including aerodynamic efficiency, stability, payload, and other technical constraints. Here are some aspects that can be considered in rocket design:
To build a rocket, the best method would be SMART, which is a method that would efficiently organize the progress of the project, defining the best achievable path to follow. First, it would be necessary to know if the project can be carried out in the conditions in which it is presented and what could be done to increase the possibilities of carrying it out, after that it would be necessary to find the materials that would be needed to complete the project and seeking the greatest cost-effective among all possibilities. Finally, the most crucial thing for the project is the time in which the project will be carried out and if it is short, SMART needs to be as organized as possible, with all members doing their part. With that defined, the project only needs to be put into practice to be carried out in the schematic way, always seeking to work around personal and group problems. After the project is finalized, we need to define the level of relevance of the project and how it will impact future projects carried out by the group and society itself.
For disclosure, we would have a short period of time, so we should create an efficient method of disclosure within a standard defined by the group. Social networks would be the main place for dissemination with a large, fast and efficient reach, saving several efforts on the part of the group. Meanwhile, the group could publicize it through other means such as pamphlets, posters and even personally, which would also greatly increase the reach of the project, creating great visibility. This process would be crucial for the growth of the project, after all, without a target audience the project becomes useless, and obviously all this must be done quickly by the group, with everyone trying their best to be the best possible, again overcoming all problems that arise during the process.

        <h2>
          Electronics</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Electronics play a vital role in every phase of a rocket's flight, from launch to stage separation, re-entry into the atmosphere and landing. As technology advances, electronic systems become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for more complex missions, rocket reuse, and long-term space exploration. One of the main aspects of rocket electronics is the Flight Control systems, these systems are responsible for ensuring that the rocket follows the desired trajectory during flight. They use sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, to measure the rocket's orientation and acceleration. Based on this data, onboard computers calculate the necessary corrections to adjust control surfaces, such as steering fins or nozzles, ensuring the rocket stays on the planned trajectory. There are also propulsion systems, electronics are involved in the control and operation of rocket engines. This includes starting engines, controlling propellant pressure, regulating burn rate, and monitoring operating conditions. Propulsion systems may also include electronics for stage separation, when a rocket stage is discarded after fuel exhaustion.

        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Rocket physics is governed by fundamental principles of mechanics, thermodynamics and fluid dynamics. To understand how rockets work, it's important to consider the physical laws that govern their propulsion, motion, and behavior in space. We can mention the Law of Action and Reaction - Newton's Third Law: The basis of rocket propulsion is Newton's Third Law, which states that "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". This means that when a rocket expels gases at high velocity through the exhaust nozzle, the backward-moving gases push the rocket forward. That action and reaction is what propels the rocket upward. There is the Law of Conservation of Mass and Energy: Thermodynamics also plays a key role in rocket physics. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total mass of an isolated system remains constant. In the case of rockets, the mass of the system decreases as fuel is burned and expelled, resulting in an increase in rocket speed in accordance with the principle of conservation of momentum. In short, rocket physics is a complex interplay between fundamental principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. Rockets turn the action of expelling gases in backward motion into a reaction of moving forward, propelling the rocket into space. Understanding these principles is essential to designing, building, and operating effective and successful rockets.
